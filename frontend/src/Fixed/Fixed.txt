here I started doing as I aways do, with a root element and dealing routes as an array of objects using Outlet as well, but it didn't work as it should though, because I had to set custom routes as the user is logged in or not I couldn't find a way (so far) using that approache, so I had to use the other way. So, for now the App.jsx is working properly with custom routes and all that stuff :D
